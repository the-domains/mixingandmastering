His new updated curriculum is based on three courses: Mixing Foundations, Next-Level Mixing and Next-Level Mastering. There are two online group classes per week as well as monthly one-on-one lessons where you can get direct feedback on your own mixes. Many Danny's students have their own commercial releases that hit the tops of the Beatport. 

His mixing method is not linked to any specific DAW you can use any VST host though Logic or Cubase are preferred and many of his students use Ableton Live.
